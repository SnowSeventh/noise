# Application of NLP in financial area
In financial area, there are so many documents to be dealed with by mankind. This time, I want to use the method of NLP to do some analyse of such kind of documents. Based on this, we can move forward in two different directions: one is building an online platform for investment bank using NLP to assist them analysing long documents; the other is designing an system for traders that can help them get the latest news of specific underlying and analyse the news with NLP. With the deliverable as a website, it can be really useful for both buy side and sell side of financial market and worth the attention of us.
