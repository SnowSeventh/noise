# Schedule of Dissertation (from Wang Peng)
## Preface
- As the second semester is undergoing and the workload is really heavy, I prefer starting my work of dissertation right after the final exam of this semester, which is at the end of May or the start of June;
- At present I plan to finish my dissertation before December 2018 and spend nearly 5 hours on average each day, which will definitly meet the recommended time of 600h.

## Timeline
**Based on above,my plan is as follow:**

1. 2018.6.1-2018.6.30 --**Preparation Period**

During this period, I want to:

- Read some past paper about my topic and find some inspiration of algo;
- Choose one way to go because I put up with 2 different application scenarios in my proposal which have totally different data structure and needed being treated with different algo. After taking the former paper as reference, I should choose one that can be achieved better by me;
- Next, I just focus on one area and spend some time gathering data as well as learning how to build a website platform.

2. 2018.7.1-2018.8.31 -- **Programing Period**

During this period, I want to:

- Build my own NN and start training with data set;
- Hope that I can get some beautiful output to show as the ***Interim Report & Initial Presentation*** is due at the start of September.

3. 2018.9.1-2018.10.31 -- **Write and Modify**

During this period, I want to:

- Start writing down the whole precess of my work;
- Leave some spare time to modify the paper and negotiate with my supervisor.

## Others
1. When the project starts, I will exchange my progress frequently with my supervisor. Now I plan to report my progress to supervisor ***every 10 days***;
2. After the second semester, students may need to do some other important things such as finding jobs besides finishing the dissertation, which means it may happen that I am not at HK when supervisor wants to meet me. In case that really happens, I will try my best to come back or I would use email to report my progress;
3. I know there is something called ***dissertation webpage*** designed by school which is used for recording my work. However, I will also use github to manage my project at the really beginning ahead of the ***dissertation webpage***. So if necessary, I can also provide a link of my github and show you what I am doing everyday with it.
